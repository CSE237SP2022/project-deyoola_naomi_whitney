# What user stories were completed this iteration?
We completed the basic information necessary for our application to function. This includes listing out the names, prices, and descriptions of each item as well as giving the user the ability to see the total price of all items and the total number of items available with tax. We also completed the chatbot, called BearBot, to chat with a customer and provide them with a promocode via an API link that generates random password combos (these password combos act as "promo codes"). We also created login form to login in a customer with an account to Bear Necessities with a username of "bearcustomer@wustl.edu" and password of "test".

# Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
Right now, BearBot chatbot and Login page work perfectly as Java applications but we are figuring out the correct translations of commands to run via our shell script.
# What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
The command needed to compile and run our code from the command: ./run_program.sh
