# What user stories were completed this iteration?
We completed the basic information necessary for our application to function. This includes listing out the names, prices, and descriptions of each item as well as giving the user the ability to see the total price of all items and the total number of items available.

# What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
We intend on actually implementing user interface and adding basic functions like adding items to the list, removing items from your cart, and having items in alphabetical order. We also intend on adding more items to the project.

# Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
No

# What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
Command line function to be added over next iteration
