# What user stories were completed this iteration?
We completed the basic information necessary for our application to function. This includes listing out the names, prices, and descriptions of each item as well as giving the user the ability to see the total price of all items and the total number of items available with tax. We had to start over this iteration so we tried implementing the previous feature better in addition to adding more features

# What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
We intend on having items in alphabetical order and categorizing items.

# Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
No

# What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
The command needed to compile and run our code from the command: ./run_program.sh
